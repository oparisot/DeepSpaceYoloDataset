## üìñ Description

DeepSpaceYoloDataset is an annotated set of smart telescopes images.

During the MILAN research project [https://www.list.lu/fr/recherche/projet/milan2/], we have compiled a large collection of deep sky images during Electronically Assisted Astronomy sessions in Luxembourg, France, Belgium.

We have used two instruments for several months (from March 2022 to September 2023): a Stellina smart telescope (https://vaonis.com/stellina) and a Vespera smart telescope (https://vaonis.com/vespera). We have captured data for a representative set of deep sky objects from the Messier / NGC / IC / Sharpless2 / Barnard catalogues. Different types of celestial objects were considered: emission/reflection/dark/planetary nebula, galaxies, globular/open clusters. Images were obtained after the capture and the stacking of sub-frames of 10 seconds exposure time. 


## üìú Dataset Structure

Training images were splitted into 608x608 patches. 

Based on the YOLOv7 format, the dataset is a ZIP file containing 4696 RGB images, and the corresponding 4696 labels text files with the positions of deep sky objets in the images.
