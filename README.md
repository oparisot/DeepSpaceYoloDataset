[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxx.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxx)

## 📖 Description

During the MILAN research project (MachIne Learning for AstroNomy), we have compiled a large collection of deep sky images during Electronically Assisted Astronomy sessions in Luxembourg, France, Belgium.

We have used two instruments for several months (from March 2022 to September 2023): a Stellina smart telescope (https://vaonis.com/stellina) and a Vespera smart telescope (https://vaonis.com/vespera). We have captured data for a representative set of deep sky objects from the Messier / NGC / IC / Sharpless2 / Barnard catalogues. Different types of celestial objects were considered: emission/reflection/dark/planetary nebula, galaxies, globular/open clusters. Images were obtained after the capture and the stacking of sub-frames of 10 seconds exposure time. 


## 📜 Dataset Structure

Training images were splitted into 608x608 patches. Based on the YOLOv7 format, the dataset is a ZIP file containing 4696 RGB images, and the corresponding 4696 labels text files with the positions of deep sky objets in the images.
